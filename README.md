# Music Store Analysis using SQL

Welcome to the **Music Store Analysis** project! This project leverages SQL to analyze data from a fictional music store, providing valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To explore and analyze various aspects of the music store's operations and customer interactions.
- **Data Sources:** The project utilizes SQL to query data stored in a relational database with multiple tables, including `employee`, `customer`, `invoice`, `track`, `playlist`, and more.
- **Analysis Topics:** We delve into diverse areas, such as sales performance, customer segmentation, popular music genres, top-selling tracks, and employee performance.
- **Tools Used:** SQL queries and database management tools are employed to extract, transform, and analyze data.

## Tables in the Database

- `employee`: Contains information about store employees, including their names, titles, birthdates, and contact details.
- `customer`: Stores customer data, including names, addresses, and support representative IDs.
- `invoice`: Holds invoice records, including customer IDs, dates, and billing information.
- `track`: Includes details about music tracks, such as names, composers, and durations.
- `playlist`: Lists various playlists available in the store.
- `artist` and `album`: Provide information about artists and albums associated with the tracks.
- `media_type` and `genre`: Categorize tracks based on media type and genre.
